  notes: |
    Single-pass refinement shows clear limitations:
    - Reasonable on simpler conflicts (L1/L2)
    - Poor on complex conflicts requiring reasoning (L3/L4)
    - No ability to "reconsider" initial refinement

    The 4.9% overall accuracy gain from iterative refinement
    justified the additional compute cost.
